# ⚙️ Steam Patch
Steam Patch is a tool designed to enhance your Steam experience by applying patches to the Steam client.

## Installation
Decky is now required due to how we patch steam now, this should make steam-patch work as long as decky works.

Decky one liner install
```
curl -L https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-installer/releases/latest/download/install_release.sh | sh
```

Steam-patch install
```
curl -L https://github.com/corando98/steam-patch/raw/main/install.sh | sh

## 🎯 Supported Devices

Offically tested devices include: ROG Ally, Legion Go

Generic features should work in most devices. 

## 🛠️ Configuration file

For customization a configuration is in place, find the config.toml in the root of the repo. Example below.

Default location is ~/steam-patch/config.toml

```
#For changes to reflect on steamUI, restart steam-patch, and restart steam. (Current mitigation)
main_enabled = true
tdp_control = true
gpu_control = true
max_tdp = 30               #If using smokeless bios you can push this higher
max_gpu = 2700

#Feature toggles
legacy_tdp = false         #true = ryzenadj, false = ACPI ROG ALLY METHOD
mapper = true              #Enable disable the QAM and Steam button mapping
spoof_glyphs = true        #Enable to change PS/Xbox buttons to match SD including Steam Menu and Option menu
nintendo_glyphs: false     #Swaps A <-> B and X <-> Y


#Experimental ROG ALLY ONLY
auto_nkey_recovery = false #Attempts to suspend and resume the device if NKEY is lost
```
Before adjusting the TDP, please ensure your device can support the new value. 
There is a tangible risk of causing damage to your device otherwise.


legacy_tdp - False, utilizes ryzenadj method of changing TDP, check if your device is compatible. ie. Legion Go, ROG Ally, etc
mapper - Only ROG ally for now, maps the QAM/Steam button to the AC/CC buttons.
auto_nkey_recovery - Extrememly hacky way of recoverying the AC/CC button due to sleep/suspend issue on Ally, use with caution.

## Steam Client

Only compatible with Stable Steam client, use beta branch for beta Steam client (breaks often)
